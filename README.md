## Example Lesson

### What is the Customizer?

The Customizer is a relatively recent addition to WordPress that allows you to change several aspects of your WordPress site from one area. [![WordPress customizer screen in the dashboard](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2015/06/wordpress-customizer-1024x553.png)](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2015/06/wordpress-customizer.png) You can access it using the Customize option in the Appearance menu or possibly the big, blue Customize Your Site button in the WordPress Dashboard, if you haven't dismissed the Welcome to WordPress! box. [![WordPress customer location in the menu](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2015/06/wordpress-customizer-menu-1024x553.png)](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2015/06/wordpress-customizer-menu.png) Each theme can choose to either use or not use the Customizer. It can also add to, subtract from, or otherwise change the Customizer to suit its purposes. Some things that are commonly found in the Customizer are sections to change colors, typography, widgets, menus, and a handful of general site settings. Even plugins can add or subtract things that appear in the Customizer.

### Using the Customizer

To use the Customizer, click on the section that you are interested in such as Colors. What appears in the Customizer panel will then change to display the controls that are available. You can change the settings as desired and you should see the results of your changes in the preview screen without having to refresh the page. [![Screenshot 2015-12-14 19.06.44](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2015/06/Screenshot-2015-12-14-19.06.44-1024x501.png)](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2015/06/Screenshot-2015-12-14-19.06.44.png) In Twenty Fifteen, you have the option to pick a color scheme or completely choose your own colors using a color picker. You can move back and forth between panels in the Customizer without losing your changes. For example, once you choose your colors, you can move to the Header Image section (or Widgets, Menus, etc.) and continuing editing. The preview screen will continue to update in real time. Once you like what you see, you will need to click the blue Save & Publish button at the top of the panel to save your work. To close the Customizer panel, click the X at the top left of the Customizer panel. You will be taken to the last screen you were on before you went to the Customizer.
